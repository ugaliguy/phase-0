<!-- Add your reflection here 

1. What did you learn about the DOM?

From JavaScript's point of view, all html elements are objects whose properties (such as innerHTML) are ones that can be set or retrieved and whose methods can perform actions such as adding or deleting an element.

2. What are some useful methods to use to manipulate the DOM?

We found the .getById and .getByTagName methods to be helpful.
I haven't mastered these methods yet.
